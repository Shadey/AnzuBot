Sat Nov 29 2014 17:18:09 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => WHAT
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:18:12 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => GROSS
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:18:17 GMT-0500 (EST) : Sylair => Well, I’m playing Black 2
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:18:25 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => :l
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:18:30 GMT-0500 (EST) : Sylair => But I haven’t decided whether to get Y or Ruby first
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:18:40 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => Uhhhh
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:19:21 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => If you want to be the "cutting edge" of pokemon 
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:19:25 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => You want to get Ruby
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:19:37 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => However Y is a better game.
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:20:50 GMT-0500 (EST) : Sylair => Y is better than Ruby?
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:20:51 GMT-0500 (EST) : Sylair => Why?
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:21:09 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => Hmmmm
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:21:11 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => To start
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:21:22 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => 3rd gen is the 2nd worst region
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:21:47 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => I think Y like
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:22:07 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => Makes you hate Ruby because HM are optional in Y
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:22:18 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => But they are a very heavy part of Ruby/Sapphire
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:22:42 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => And it sort of annoying that a large portion of the HM are only for Water pokemon
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:22:46 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => Its annoying
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:23:03 GMT-0500 (EST) : Sylair => That’s true
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:23:08 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => The Hidden pokemon mechanic in the game is weird
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:23:10 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => Well
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:23:11 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => Not weird
Sat Nov 29 2014 17:23:12 GMT-0500 (EST) : Sylair => I think 3rd Gen is 2nd best though

Sat Nov 29 2014 18:15:39 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => Because collector value is period dependent
Sat Nov 29 2014 18:20:48 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => Why collect things where the price isn't going to change?
Sat Nov 29 2014 18:20:51 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => Well

Sat Nov 29 2014 19:09:34 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => Better than the monster of a thing he has now
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:09:48 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => Be a real woman and make your gun
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:09:53 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => With a 3D printer.

Sat Nov 29 2014 19:10:27 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => xD

Sat Nov 29 2014 19:12:13 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => Karkitty I've got an Italian Beretta 92fs. It's full frame so not really an ideal concealed but it feels really nice. 9mm
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:12:55 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => It's metal so the weight keep recoil in check. Like it way more than my friend's Taurus. Silly plastic.
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:13:00 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => Chimera: Dude that sounds fucking awesome. We don't have much money right now. So we are just getting this small Taurus PT-22.

Sat Nov 29 2014 19:16:28 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => Koneko, you didn't change the colours
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:16:29 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => I want to pick up a 1911 at some point, but if I move to Canada that might be too much of a hassle
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:16:31 GMT-0500 (EST) : Shadey => ;___;
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:16:42 GMT-0500 (EST) : Koneko => I will eventually
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:16:43 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => Gun laws too picky over there
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:16:55 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => Ah
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:17:03 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => I might have to leave my 92 with my parents :c
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:17:11 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => Leme show you the Taurus that i was planning on getting

Sat Nov 29 2014 19:18:59 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => Like i said 
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:19:05 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => It's small but will kick ass xD
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:19:23 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => Everything you looking at in .22?
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:19:37 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => It's my first gun
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:19:40 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => My dad said
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:19:45 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => A .22 will be best
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:19:50 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => .22 is fun and supposed to be really cheap, but you can't find ammo anywhere. sells too fast.
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:20:09 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => Not a good defense round but it'll be good to learn your form.
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:20:11 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => Yeah it's like 200 or so dollars
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:20:22 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => Like I said I'm cheap on money
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:20:26 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => Yea
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:20:37 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => Got any you recommend?
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:20:41 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => I bought mine when I was working full time and had no plans for life
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:20:59 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => Mmm
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:22:20 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => Chi-mer-a~
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:22:23 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => I haven't gotten to try that many out. If you want to try something full sized I LOVE my Beretta and would reccommend you try one out. Glocks are loved by so many but I personally HATE the way they feel in my hand. Too square. Like a stack of legos. A friend of mine has a Springfield XD he spoke highly of but I never got to try it out. Never shot with him. <__<
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:22:25 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => Got any you rec?
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:22:27 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => O w8
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:22:47 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => I was going to try out the Glock 17
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:23:10 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => My dad doesn't like autos much
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:23:18 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => Says they hang up too much
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:23:38 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => If you look at Berettas, the 92 and M9 are essentially the same thing. M9 is just the military designation with some minor design shifts.
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:24:04 GMT-0500 (EST) : daccano => hello i'm back
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:24:05 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => G17s should be reliable I just hate the physical grip
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:24:13 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => The beretta you have looks fucking beautiful btw
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:24:19 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => xD
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:24:20 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => OH and if you can try out a 1911
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:24:22 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => I looked it up
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:24:31 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => 1911?
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:25:21 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => How much recoil do you get on your beretta?
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:25:42 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => It depends on the bullets right?
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:25:48 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => The recoil?
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:26:00 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => I'm not sure i'm kinda new to this
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:27:41 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => The recoil isn't bad at all. Like I said it's a metal frame so the weight of the barrel keeps it from kicking too much. Mine is chambered in 9mm which I'd say is probably the "best" round.
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:27:59 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => Ah
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:28:05 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => Relatively cheap to fire, but not too small to where it becomes useless for defense.
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:28:18 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => And what do you know about the .22 beretta bobcat?
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:29:32 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => The M1911 is pretty much the design all semi auto pistols are based on. It's classic. Was the standard issue sidearm for the US through WWII and such. They look class and feel great. Kick is stronger though cause they're standard is .45acp, notably bigger than the 9mm.
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:29:50 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => Tons of different companies make 1911s now. Nobody owns the design far as I know.
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:30:08 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => I've only used the 92 so I can't say much for others.
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:30:20 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => Honestly I don't know as much about guns as I'm able to make it sound like I know
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:30:30 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => I don't know as much about ANYTHING as I make it sound xD
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:30:57 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => Huehue xD

Sat Nov 29 2014 19:32:00 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => I will swoon over guns like i will swoon over men i swear
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:34:18 GMT-0500 (EST) : Karkitty => I wish I had enough to get that one revolver
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:34:27 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => I'd love a revolver at some point
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:34:28 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => OH
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:34:31 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => BY THE WAY
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:34:35 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => If you're into rifles too

Sat Nov 29 2014 19:47:43 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => Only downside about the cheap ammo is it's got some corrosive element to it so you have to clean the gun out IMMEDIATELY when you're done for the day or it's gonna sit and eat your barrel.
Sat Nov 29 2014 19:47:49 GMT-0500 (EST) : Katyusha => ^I love that song btw

Sat Nov 29 2014 20:06:41 GMT-0500 (EST) : Koneko => You know, future reference. I know not to ask you things that are too personal now
Sat Nov 29 2014 20:06:45 GMT-0500 (EST) : Koneko => Which is perfectly acceptable
Sat Nov 29 2014 20:06:48 GMT-0500 (EST) : Mekakushi => Oh okay

Sat Nov 29 2014 20:07:09 GMT-0500 (EST) : Koneko => Your hosts tell us your ISP. Which tells us your state
Sat Nov 29 2014 20:07:27 GMT-0500 (EST) : Koneko => Hang on, I'll show you

Sat Nov 29 2014 21:02:04 GMT-0500 (EST) : Chimera => You're spamming. Plain and simple. If it were any other site, you'd be temp banned at the least. I don't know if the BBS has any sort of banning system, but you're setting yourself up to be a hated user.
